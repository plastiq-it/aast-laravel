## Assessment Requirement

### Description

The assessment has two parts:

#### Part 1

The candidate needs to implement a backend `REST` API - GET `/api/products/` which returns a list of all
products. 

#### Part 2

The candidate needs to display all products in `Wordpress` page then the public user is able to see a list of products on Web page.


This is a take-away assessment should take no longer than 2-3 hours.

### Implementation Details

#### Part 1

1. Please Fork this repo and install this laravel repo locally

2. The code has provided a simple structure for you to start:

    - A `ProductApiController.php` that contains a function which requires you to implement the logic
    - A `ProductApiRequest.php`
    - A `Product.php` eloquent model
    - A registered route in `api.php` (we do not require any auth or middleware in this assessment)
    - A seeder class for you to seed initial Product data for live testing
    - A factory file `ProductFactory.php` - use it for mock
    
3. Please finish API endpoint by satisfying the following requirements:

    The API needs to satisfy
        
       GET /api/products
        
    - supports query filter: `is_active` only accepts `1` or `0` and its `required`
    - support query validation by using `ProductApiRequest.php`
    - products should not display `hidden_information` field
    - Write a feature test for the API. The test needs to check status and response data.
    

#### Part 2

1. Install a fresh wordpress project on your own
2. Call the API that you have done in Part 1
3. Display result in a wordpress page as HTML format:

````html
<ul>
    <li>Product 1</li>
    <li>Product 2</li>
    ....
</ul>
```` 


### Submission

#### Part 1
1. Adding all your notes into this `readme`
2. Send us your forked repo link

#### Part 2
1. create a public repo under your github account for the WP project, and send us the link
2. Include any special setup details if you need to tell us in the `readme`


### Bonus

If you think the task can be done within a short time frame, you can consider adding your own features to the assessment.

Some potential add-ons:

- Add filter option on `is_active` in wordpress page
- Add wildcard search on name filter in API or in wordpress page
- Or any other idea you could come up with

You can be creative and expand functionality as long as requirements are met.


Happy Coding!
